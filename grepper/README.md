grepper - Search multiple words in files
===========================

Search recursively for multiple words found in files using grep, so for example I need to find a file with the words 'researched' 'found' 'belonging', I would call this like:

./grepper researched found belonging

Syntax: grepper -i <first> <second> <third> ...

The -i switch is for case insensitive search
