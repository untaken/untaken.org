grepper - Search multiple words in files
---------------------------

Syntax: grepper -i <first> <second> <third> ...

   -i switch is for case insensitive search

Search recursively for multiple words found in files using grep, so for example I need to find a file with the words 'researched' 'found' 'belonging', I would call this like:

./grepper researched found belonging

This will list all the files recursively in the current directory with the three words researched, found and belonging.
