This software is free and is OpenSource, so feel free to do whatever you like with it. 
Make sure you update the blog post <link> if you do 

Little script to be able to call as many servers you like with a command. Simply 
call like:

./fork_servers.pl somehost.co.uk someotherhost.com ...

It will return the results from all the hosts prepending <host>: in front

Only requirement is that you setup SSH keys so no password is required.
